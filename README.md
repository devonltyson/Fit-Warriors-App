## General info
The Fit Warriors application tracks your workouts and records the data as statistics for a virtual character. Select the skill you'd like to train and your character will gain experience as you workout. When you've gotten the required experience, you will gain a level in the specified skill. The higher the skill level, the more experience it takes to level which progressively increases the difficulty.

Developers: Devon Tyson, Dakota Ruhl, Kenneth Omo, Jose Hernandez, and Victor Hernandez
